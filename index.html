    <h1>About me:</h1>
<body>
 I am a very lazy person but when it comes down to it I usually finish things earlier or 
on time. I also like to read, play games or play with dogs, this helps me take some time off on study works and lastly learn different codes and other programming language.
<br>
Favorites: Reading Manga and etc, Playing games, Sleeping, Eating, Walking around with the dogs (occasiontally take a random walks with the dogs) and lastly Riding a bike from time to time.
<br>
School Projects: Research on the past, few codings and other things like helping with school activities and other projects like PT in the past grades/years.
<br>
Talents: I'm not that much of a talented person but I know how to get things done with a little guidance and I will try my best on helping others when needed.
